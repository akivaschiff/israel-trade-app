# K-Means Color Scale Implementation

## 🎉 What We Achieved

Implemented **automatic k-means clustering** to find natural breaks in trade data for better color visualization.

## 📊 Results

The algorithm found 6 natural bands based on log-transformed trade values:

```
Band 1:   $6K - $56K      (12 countries)  - Minimal trade
Band 2:   $94K - $468K    (17 countries)  - Small partners
Band 3:   $561K - $1.89M  (18 countries)  - Minor partners  
Band 4:   $2.45M - $8.69M (28 countries)  - Medium partners
Band 5:   $9.98M - $45.32M (20 countries) - Significant partners
Band 6:   $47.57M - $1.23B (20 countries) - Major partners
```

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Boundary Issue Fix**
**Problem**: Top countries (like China) at exact max value weren't getting colored.

**Solution**: Changed from `min/max` to `gte/lte` (greater/less than or equal) in piecewise visual map:
```javascript
const pieces = colorBands.map((band, index) => {
  const isLast = index === colorBands.length - 1
  return {
    gte: band.min,  // inclusive lower bound
    lte: isLast ? maxValue * 1.01 : band.max,  // extend last band to catch max
    color: band.color
  }
})
```

### 2. **Country Name Mapping Fix**
**Problem**: Turkey/Türkiye not showing on map due to spelling differences.

**Solution**: Added mapping in `useWorldMap.js`:
```javascript
'Türkiye': 'Turkey',  // Database uses Turkish spelling
'Turkey': 'Turkey',   // Ensure consistency
```

### 3. **Debug Logging Added**
Added comprehensive logging to catch future issues:
- Checks for unmapped countries
- Validates specific problem countries (China, Australia, Turkey)
- Shows database name vs. map name for debugging

## 🔬 How K-Means Works

1. **Log Transform**: Convert skewed data (`$6K - $1.23B`) to log scale for better clustering
2. **K-Means Clustering**: Find 6 natural groupings in log space
3. **Transform Back**: Convert cluster boundaries back to original dollar values
4. **Assign Colors**: Map each cluster to a color from the gradient

## 🎨 Benefits Over Linear/Percentile Scales

✅ **Data-driven**: Automatically adapts to actual distribution
✅ **Natural breaks**: Groups similar-value countries together
✅ **Better visibility**: Every tier clearly distinguished
✅ **No manual tuning**: No arbitrary percentile cutoffs needed

## 📝 Files Modified

1. `/src/lib/kmeansScale.js` - K-means clustering implementation
2. `/src/views/world-map/WorldMapPage.vue` - Applied k-means to visual map
3. `/src/views/world-map/useWorldMap.js` - Added Turkey mapping

## 🧪 Testing

Check the browser console for detailed analysis:
- Distribution statistics
- K-means bands with country counts
- Country name mapping validation
- Warnings for unmapped countries

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Could experiment with different number of bands (5-8)
- Could use silhouette score to automatically determine optimal k
- Could cache cluster results for performance (currently recomputes on every render)
