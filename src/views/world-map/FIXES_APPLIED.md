# World Map Page - Fixes Applied

## Critical Fix #1: Flow Types Were Backwards ‚úÖ

### The Problem
The database uses a **non-standard convention**:
- `flow = 1` = **IMPORTS** (Israel buys from other countries)
- `flow = 2` = **EXPORTS** (Israel sells to other countries)

The constants were originally defined backwards, causing the UI to show imports when "Exports" was selected.

### The Fix
Updated `/src/lib/tradeConstants.js`:
```javascript
export const FLOW_TYPES = {
  IMPORTS: 1,  // flow=1 in database (non-standard convention)
  EXPORTS: 2,  // flow=2 in database
}
```

### Result
‚úÖ Clicking "Exports" now correctly shows export data (USA should be high)
‚úÖ Clicking "Imports" now correctly shows import data (China should be high)

## Fix #2: Values Were Off by 1000x ‚úÖ

### The Problem
Database stores values in **thousands of USD**, but we were displaying them directly without multiplying.
- Russia showing $201K instead of $201M

### The Fix
Updated `formatValue()` function in both files:
```javascript
function formatValue(value) {
  // Multiply by 1000 since database stores values in thousands of USD
  const actualValue = value * 1000
  
  if (actualValue >= 1e9) {
    return `${(actualValue / 1e9).toFixed(2)}B`
  } else if (actualValue >= 1e6) {
    return `${(actualValue / 1e6).toFixed(2)}M`
  }
  // ... etc
}
```

Applied to:
- `WorldMapPage.vue` - main map tooltips
- `CountryDetailPanel.vue` - detail panel values

### Result
‚úÖ All values now display correctly (e.g., Russia shows ~$200M not $200K)

---

## Fix #3: Scale Changed to Linear with Threshold ‚úÖ

### The Problem
- Logarithmic scale made it hard to distinguish between countries with zero trade vs. small trade
- Color distribution was uneven

### The Fix
Changed from logarithmic to **linear scale with minimum threshold**:

```javascript
// Set minimum threshold at $1M (1000 in database units)
const minThreshold = 1000 // $1M in thousands
const minValue = Math.max(minThreshold, Math.min(...values))
```

Visual map changed from `piecewise` to `continuous`:
```javascript
visualMap: {
  type: 'continuous',
  min: minValue,
  max: maxValue,
  calculable: true,
  // ...
}
```

Countries below $1M threshold are shown as gray (no trade).

### Result
‚úÖ Clear visual distinction between no trade (gray) and low trade (lightest color)
‚úÖ Better color gradient distribution
‚úÖ More intuitive scale - larger values are proportionally larger colors

## Summary of Changes

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Flow types | Backwards (Exports showed imports) | ‚úÖ Correct (Exports shows exports) |
| Value display | $201K for Russia | ‚úÖ $201M for Russia |
| Scale | Logarithmic (hard to read) | ‚úÖ Linear with $1M threshold |
| Zero vs. small trade | Both looked similar | ‚úÖ Clear distinction |

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Click "Exports" ‚Üí Should see USA, Germany, UK as top partners
- [x] Click "Imports" ‚Üí Should see China, Germany, USA as top partners
- [x] Hover over major trading partner ‚Üí Values should be in millions/billions, not thousands
- [x] Map colors ‚Üí Clear gradient from gray (no trade) to dark blue/orange (high trade)
- [x] Click country ‚Üí Detail panel shows correct values (multiplied by 1000)

## Files Modified

1. `/src/lib/tradeConstants.js` - Fixed FLOW_TYPES constants
2. `/src/views/world-map/WorldMapPage.vue` - Linear scale + value formatting
3. `/src/views/world-map/CountryDetailPanel.vue` - Value formatting

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Database Convention**: Always remember `flow=1` means IMPORTS in this dataset (non-standard)

üí° **Value Units**: Database stores values in thousands of USD, always multiply by 1000 for display

üé® **Colors**: Blue = Exports, Orange = Imports (from shared constants)
