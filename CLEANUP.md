# Cleanup Note

The following files can be safely deleted (Render-specific, no longer needed):

```bash
rm render.yaml
rm RENDER_DEPLOY.md
rm DEPLOY_SUMMARY.md  # Old render-focused summary
rm DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md  # Old generic checklist
```

Keep these Railway files:
- ✅ `railway.toml`
- ✅ `backend/railway.json`
- ✅ `railway-frontend.json`
- ✅ `RAILWAY_DEPLOY.md`
- ✅ `DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md` (updated for Railway)
- ✅ `START_HERE.md` (updated for Railway)
